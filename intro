# Welcome to the illumos developer's guide!

Welcome to illumos! We're excited that your'e interested in doing work on this
project. This guide covers the basic workflow for developing illumos and then
dives into specific detail on everything from the layout of the gate to several
HOWTOs. Whether this is your first time working with illumos or you remember
back when the code in the gate all referred to something called SunOS, this
guide will help you in enhancing and fixing illumos.

## What is illumos?

illumos is a consolidation of software that forms the core of an Operating
System. It includes the kernel, device drivers, core system libraries, and
utilities. It is the home of many technologies include ZFS, DTrace, Zones, ctf,
FMA, and more. We pride ourselves on having a stable, highly observable, and
technologically different system. In addition, illumos traces it roots back
through Sun Microsystems to the original releases of `UNIX` and `BSD`.

## Guide Layout

This guide is broken into the following sections:


  * Basic illumos workflow

  This section aims to get a new developer up and building illumos. It covers
  what to do from first clone through putback. If you're just getting started
  with illumos, this is where you should start.


  * illumos Guidelines and Principles

  This section covers various core guidelines we have when working inside of
  illumos gate. It also goes into detail about several of the guiding
  engineering principles that have been guided this project from its time at Sun
  through to today.


  * Source Tree Layout and Makefile System

  This walks through the layout of the source tree. This covers where different
  components live and the general design of the illumos source tree as well as
  an introduction to the Makefile structure and top level targets in the tree.


  * Component Anatomy, Creating and Modifying Components

  This sections covers working in specific components of the kernel. It first
  covers the anatomy of different libraries, commands, and kernel modules, and
  device drivers. It then builds on top of this and discusses how to modify
  existing ones as well as how to create new ones. Makefiles, dealing with 3rd
  party source code, CTF data, and other issues that come up when building new
  components.


  * Debugging

  And then it all went terribly wrong -- processes core dumping and operating
  systems panicking. Don't panic! This section introduces you to tools and
  techniques for investigating such problems and help you along the road to root
  causing such issues. It also briefly discusses how to control the generation
  of such dumps as well as introducing system tools like mdb(1) and dtrace(1m).


  * Integrating Changes

  This section covers best practices around testing, getting necessary review,
  and getting changes inside of the gate.


  * Getting Help

  This section covers where to go with questions and how to get additional help
  on working with illumos, this document, or anything else that might come up.

## Conventions

The following describes the current typographical conventions in use in this
document.

When text begins as follows, it indicates that it's being run as a normal user
shell:

```
$
```

When text begins as follows, it indicates that it is being run as a super-user's
shell:

```
#
```

When text is formatted as `name(number)` that indicates that it is referring to
the command with the name `name`, and in the section described by number. For
example, read(2) refers to the read function in section 2 of the manual page,
while ctf(4), would refer to the manual page on the CTF file format which is in
section 4,  and finally connect(3SOCKET), refers to the connect function that's
found in the `3SOCKET` section of the manual, which are functions that are a
part of the library, `libsocket`.
